# Diversity & Inclusion

### Briefing

Human Resources at Phone Now Call Centre is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help.

#### The task 🛠️

Create a dashboard in Power BI that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. The Call Centre HR is looking for an accurate overview of its diversity and inclusion program among its employees.

#### My solution 👨🏻‍💻

After cleaning and modelling the data to a star schema, my solution was to create a dashboard that answered the KPIs, focusing on the following points:

🟢   The gender balance needed
🟢   Employee improvement needed among workers from a specific category
🟢   Employee promotions in different job levels and departments

As part of my PwC Virtual Internship, I created a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.
